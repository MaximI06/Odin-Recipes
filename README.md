# Odin Recipes

This project is part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal of the project is to build a simple recipe book web page that displays various recipes with images and descriptions.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will demonstrate my skills in:

- Using basic HTML to structure a webpage
- Implementing CSS to style a webpage and make it responsive
- Organizing content using semantic HTML tags
- Working with image files and embedding them into a webpage
- Applying learned web development concepts to build a project from scratch

## Self-Reflection

This project will help me solidify my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I look forward to learning how to structure content effectively while keeping accessibility in mind. The project will also help me understand how to manage project files and use GitHub to track my progress.
