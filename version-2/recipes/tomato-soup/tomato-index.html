        <p>Creamy Tomato Basil Soup is a warm and comforting dish that combines the bold, tangy 
        flavor of tomatoes with the richness of cream and the aromatic touch of fresh basil. 
        This soup begins with sautéed onions and garlic, which provide a savory base and 
        enhance the tomatoes' natural sweetness. After simmering with broth, the tomatoes break 
        down to create a smooth, hearty consistency that’s blended with heavy cream, giving the 
        soup a luscious, velvety texture.</p>
    
        <p>Perfect for a cozy evening, this tomato soup is incredibly versatile and pairs well 
        with crusty bread or a classic grilled cheese sandwich. Finished with fresh basil 
        and a sprinkle of Parmesan, each spoonful is a balance of acidity and creaminess, 
        making it both refreshing and indulgent. This simple yet elegant recipe is ideal for 
        those seeking a flavorful, homemade soup that’s ready in under 30 minutes.</p>

    <div class="list" id="steps-list">
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until soft and translucent, 
                about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes and broth, stirring to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the 
                heat and let it simmer for about 15 minutes to develop the flavors.</li>
            <li>Stir in the heavy cream and fresh basil, cooking for an additional 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, 
                and a little sugar if the soup tastes too acidic.</li>
            <li>For a smoother texture, use an immersion blender to blend the soup directly in the pot, or transfer it in 
                batches to a regular blender.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and extra basil leaves if desired. This creamy, 
                comforting soup pairs wonderfully with a slice of crusty bread or a classic grilled cheese sandwich!</li>
